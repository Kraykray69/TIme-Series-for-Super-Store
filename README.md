# TIme Series Model for SuperStore Dataset

Applying a time series model to a superstore dataset involves analyzing and predicting various business metrics over time, such as sales. Time series models can identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in historical data. This helps in forecasting future values, allowing the store to optimize stock management, plan promotions, and make informed business decisions. For instance, the model can predict peak sales periods or anticipate inventory needs, leading to better resource allocation and increased efficiency.
